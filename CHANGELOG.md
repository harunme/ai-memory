# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- HTTP transport now defaults to **stateless** mode (`json_response`, no
  `Mcp-Session-Id` required), so stateless MCP clients (OpenCode
  `type: "remote"`, `curl`) work without an `mcp-remote` stdio shim
  ([#3]). New `serve --transport http --http-stateful` flag restores the
  previous session+SSE behaviour for clients that need it.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-24

### Added
- Wiki-structure migration framework: `wiki_migrations` SQL table (V06),
  `WikiMigration` trait, migration registry, and `run_pending` runner
  invoked at server startup before the watcher starts.
- MCP read tools (`memory_query`, `memory_recent`, `memory_status`,
  `memory_briefing`, `memory_explore`) accept an optional `project`
  argument to target a specific project on a shared server.

### Fixed
- OpenCode hook events (`tool.execute.*`, `session.*`) were rejected with
  "missing session_id" because OpenCode sends `sessionID` (capital `ID`)
  and the extractor only matched `sessionId`. All spellings are now
  accepted ([#1]).
- MCP read tools were locked to the server's static `--project` (default
  `scratch`), so on a shared HTTP server they returned empty memory even
  while hooks populated the correct per-cwd project. The hook router now
  publishes the active project to a shared pointer that the read tools
  use as their default; an explicit `project` argument overrides it ([#2]).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- Per-project UUID-namespaced wiki layout: pages live at
  `<wiki_root>/<workspace_id>/<project_id>/<page-path>`. Rename is now
  a single column update; purge is `remove_dir_all` on the project dir.
- CLI becomes a thin HTTP client: `bootstrap`, `status`, `search`,
  `reorg`, `lint`, `forget-sweep`, `embed`, `commit`, `backup`,
  `write-page` all delegate to the running server via `/admin/*` routes.
  The server is the sole writer of wiki + SQLite.
- `purge-project` command with cascade-delete indexes and per-project
  isolation guard (refuses to delete files claimed by sibling projects).
- `rename-project` command: column-only rename, no file moves.
- `memory_install_self_routing` MCP tool: installs the agent-routing
  snippet into CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / `.cursorrules` in one call.
- Read-only HTTP wiki browser (`/web`) with project tree, page view,
  and full-text search.
- Bearer token auth (`AI_MEMORY_AUTH_TOKEN` / `generate-auth-token`),
  Host-header allowlist, and 10 MB body cap for the HTTP server.
- `backup` / `restore` commands using `.tar.gz` archives with live-process
  guard (refuses to run if another `ai-memory` is active on the same data dir).
- Per-cwd project routing in hooks: observations route to the project
  matching the agent's working directory, not the server default.
- `opencode` / `openclaw` aliases for the OpenCode MCP client.
- Dockerised CLI wrapper (`bin/ai-memory`) with auto-restart for the
  local container and nudge for remote upgrades.
- `bootstrap` serialises parallel runs to prevent duplicate project creation
  and handles the case where the CWD has no git repo.
- Monthly log-md rotation to keep `log.md` from growing unbounded.
- `memory_consolidate` PreCompact checkpointing falls back to rule-based
  summarisation when no LLM is configured.
- `docs/lifecycle-ops.md`: safety matrix for state-touching commands
  (reset, restore, purge-project, rename-project).
- `docs/wiki-migrations.md`: when and how to write a wiki migration.

### Changed
- `bin/ai-memory` forwards `AI_MEMORY_SERVER_URL` and no longer creates
  `-w` mount-conflict directories.
- `bootstrap` resolves the repo root via `libgit2`, removing the
  `git` binary dependency.
- Admin routes consolidated: dry-run support, correct status codes,
  deduplicated handlers.
- Host-header allowlist sourced from `Config.allowed_hosts`; logged at
  startup so operators can verify the effective list.

### Fixed
- `AI_MEMORY_HOST_CWD` handling and dry-run no-project side effects.
- Web page view: strip leading H1 from body to prevent title duplication.
- `install-mcp` Codex config key was `bearer_token`, not
  `http_headers` / `headers`.
- Consolidator used server startup default project instead of the
  session's actual project.

## What it is

LLM coding agents lose all context when a session ends. ai-memory
gives them a shared, persistent wiki: every prompt, tool call, and
decision is captured automatically; when a session ends, the relevant
pages get rewritten as a coherent narrative; when the next agent
starts (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, …) it sees a handoff with
"where you left off" already prepended.

The wiki is plain markdown in a git repo — `grep`-able, openable in
Obsidian, backed up with `rsync`. No vector database to babysit, no
`write_note` ceremony, no manual context-loading. The full design is
in [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md); the influences and
priors are at the [bottom](#influences-and-prior-art).

## Quick start

You need: Docker + an agent CLI (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor,
or anything else that speaks MCP).

```bash
# 1. Install the ai-memory CLI wrapper (a ~3 KB shell script that
#    runs the binary inside docker with your $HOME mounted). This is
#    the only thing that needs to live on the host filesystem.
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akitaonrails/ai-memory/main/bin/ai-memory \
    -o ~/.local/bin/ai-memory
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/ai-memory
# Most distros put ~/.local/bin on PATH automatically. If `which
# ai-memory` comes up empty, add this to ~/.bashrc / ~/.zshrc:
#     export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# 2. Generate a bearer token (one-time; save it).
export AI_MEMORY_AUTH_TOKEN=$(ai-memory generate-auth-token)

# 3. Start the server. `--restart unless-stopped` makes it come back
#    on docker daemon restart and on machine boot (provided your
#    docker service is enabled at boot — `sudo systemctl enable
#    docker` on most distros). Omit the LLM / EMBEDDING lines for
#    zero-LLM mode — FTS5 search still works without any keys.
docker run -d --name ai-memory \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    -p 49374:49374 \
    -v ai-memory-data:/data \
    -e AI_MEMORY_AUTH_TOKEN="$AI_MEMORY_AUTH_TOKEN" \
    -e AI_MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic \
    -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... \
    -e AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai \
    -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... \
    akitaonrails/ai-memory:latest

# 4. Wire your agent CLI in two commands. The wrapper takes care of
#    mounts + auto-detecting ~/.claude/settings.json. Re-run with
#    `--agent codex`, `--agent opencode`, `--client cursor`, etc.
#    for additional agents; full list in docs/install.md.
ai-memory install-mcp   --client claude-code --apply \
    --server-url "http://localhost:49374/mcp"
ai-memory install-hooks --agent  claude-code --apply \
    --server-url "http://localhost:49374"
```

Both `install-mcp` and `install-hooks` are idempotent — re-runs
replace ai-memory's entry, preserve every other server / hook the
user has configured, and write a timestamped `.bak-<ts>` next to the
file before each modifying write. The hook scripts are staged into
`~/.local/share/ai-memory/hooks/<agent>/` automatically; re-running
overwrites them so future image updates ship updated hooks. Drop
`--apply` to print the snippet instead of mutating.

That's it. Start a Claude Code session as usual — every prompt and
tool call now lands in ai-memory, and the next session you open in
this project will see a handoff with where you left off.

> **Prefer docker compose?** Clone the repo and run
> `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d` instead of
> step 3. The bundled compose file already has
> `restart: unless-stopped`, a healthcheck, and the named volume
> wired up; step 4 is identical.

### Keeping ai-memory up to date

The wrapper checks Docker Hub at most once every 24 hours and prints
a one-line warning to stderr when a newer image is available. To
upgrade:

```bash
ai-memory upgrade
```

In order: (1) self-upgrades the wrapper script itself by re-fetching
`bin/ai-memory` from GitHub (validated against the shebang; falls
back gracefully if curl is missing or perms block the in-place
replacement), (2) `docker pull`s the latest image, (3) re-stages
hook scripts under `~/.local/share/ai-memory/hooks/<agent>/` for
every agent you've configured, and (4) tells you how to restart the
server container so the new binary is picked up. The hook refresh
is idempotent — re-running `install-hooks --apply` replaces the
seven keys ai-memory owns and leaves every other hook the user has
wired up alone. Set `AI_MEMORY_NO_VERSION_CHECK=1` to silence the
daily check, or `AI_MEMORY_WRAPPER_URL=<url>` to pin the self-upgrade
source (e.g. a fork or a tagged release).

> **Inside ai-jail (or any bwrap sandbox)?** The wrapper at
> `~/.local/bin/ai-memory` works fine — the sandbox bind-mounts
> `~/.local` read-only, so the script is visible from inside, and
> `/var/run/docker.sock` is already passed through. Run the
> `install-*` commands *outside* ai-jail (they need to write to
> `~/.local/share/ai-memory/hooks/`, which the sandbox keeps
> read-only); daily use from inside the sandbox needs no binary at
> all (agents reach ai-memory over MCP).

**For everything else** — Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, Claude Desktop,
Gemini CLI, OpenClaw, the curl-based hook installer (no docker
needed), running ai-memory without docker, the full subcommand
reference, the homelab deploy pattern, security hardening — see
[**`docs/install.md`**](docs/install.md).

## How it works in practice

You mostly don't think about it. Hooks capture every prompt + tool
call + session boundary automatically. The agent gains awareness of
prior work without you typing anything special. A few patterns are
worth knowing:

### Cross-agent handoff

```
$ claude
> "Working on the auth refactor. JWT rotation story is broken; trying
   session cookies as an alternative."
[work for an hour]
> /exit

$ codex   # in the same directory, hours or days later
[SessionStart hook fetches the handoff; the next agent sees it.]
> "Picking up: you were investigating session cookies as an
   alternative to broken JWT rotation. Continuing?"
```

You did nothing special. Handoff created automatically on Claude
Code's session-end, surfaced automatically on Codex's session-start.

### Compaction recovery

When Claude Code or Codex compact their working context, the
`PreCompact` hook fires and ai-memory writes a fresh
`sessions/<id>.md` page summarising the session so far. After
compaction, the agent can recover the summary via `memory_recent`
even though its raw history is gone.

### Adopting ai-memory mid-project: bootstrap

If you're installing ai-memory in a project you've been working on
for months, the wiki starts empty and the first few sessions are
net-zero — you're populating, not retrieving. `ai-memory bootstrap`
solves that by LLM-summarising your existing `git log`, README,
`docs/`, and module-level doc-comments into seed wiki pages.

```bash
# Run from your project's repo root (requires an LLM provider on the
# server). Default settings ingest everything; budget caps at 50k
# input tokens (~$0.05 with Claude Haiku 4.5). The wrapper auto-mounts the
# data volume and $PWD into the container.
ai-memory bootstrap --workspace homelab --project myproj
```

Bootstrap produces a `wiki/bootstrap.md` manifest listing every page
generated + a one-paragraph rationale. Run with `--dry-run` first to
preview which sources would be sent without paying for the LLM call.
Re-running on the same project requires `--force`.

See [`docs/install.md`](docs/install.md#bootstrap-mid-project) for
the full flag reference + per-source priority order.

### Spelunking your own history

```bash
docker exec ai-memory ls /data/wiki/sessions/
docker exec ai-memory cat /data/wiki/sessions/<uuid>.md

# Open in Obsidian / any markdown viewer:
docker cp ai-memory:/data/wiki ./my-ai-memory-wiki

# Time-travel:
docker exec ai-memory git -C /data/wiki log --oneline
```

### Browse the wiki in a browser

For a more navigable view, start the server with `--enable-web` and
open `http://<host>:49374/web` in any browser. Project-list homepage,
per-project page tree with breadcrumbs, rendered markdown with syntax
highlighting and metadata (tier, kind, pinned, supersedes chain),
plus FTS5 search — all read-only, no editing. Light/dark theme
follows your OS setting via `prefers-color-scheme`.

```bash
ai-memory serve --transport http --bind 127.0.0.1:49374 --enable-web
# or, if you run via docker compose, add it to the command line in
# docker-compose.yml: ["serve", "--transport", "http", "--bind",
# "0.0.0.0:49374", "--enable-web"]
```

The web routes are mounted at `/web` on the same axum server as the
MCP endpoint, so the bearer-auth posture is identical (set
`AI_MEMORY_AUTH_TOKEN` and pass `Authorization: Bearer …` from the
browser, or front the server with a reverse proxy that handles its
own auth, or keep the bind loopback-only).

### Rules vs facts — ai-memory tells you when something belongs in CLAUDE.md

When you type something like "don't forget to never add a function
without a unit test", that's a **durable project rule**, not a
session-level observation. Rules need to fire on every relevant
action — that's what your project's `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` is for
(it's loaded into the agent's system prompt every turn), while
ai-memory queries only fire when the agent thinks to call them.

The consolidator now classifies each compiled observation as
`decision | fact | rule | gotcha`. Rule-tagged pages are auto-routed
to `wiki/_rules/<slug>.md`, and the next time you run `memory_lint`
the agent sees a suggestion:

> **rule_suggestion**: Page `_rules/never-ship-code-without-test.md`
> looks like a durable project rule. Consider copying it into your
> project's CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md so the agent sees it on every
> turn, not just when it remembers to call memory_query.

ai-memory never edits your `CLAUDE.md` itself — the suggestion is
the whole UX. You copy what's useful, ignore what isn't.

### Nudge the agent to *use* memory proactively

Lifecycle hooks handle *capture* and *handoff resume* without you
typing anything. Proactive *querying* still depends on the agent
thinking to call `memory_query`. For projects where memory matters,
one command installs the recommended snippet into your `CLAUDE.md`:

```bash
ai-memory install-instructions --target ./CLAUDE.md
```

The block is wrapped in `<!-- ai-memory:start -->` /
`<!-- ai-memory:end -->` markers so re-running picks up an updated
snippet without duplicating. Use `--target ./AGENTS.md` for
non-Claude agents, or any other path for project-rules files
(`.cursor/rules`, `.windsurfrules`, etc.). Append `--print` to
preview without writing.

## LLM provider — recommended defaults

You can run ai-memory entirely without an LLM (FTS5 search +
rule-based summaries, $0). When you *do* configure one, the
options below are ranked by fitness for ai-memory's
consolidation workload — see
[`docs/llm-provider-comparison.md`](docs/llm-provider-comparison.md)
for the empirical writeup behind this ranking.

> **TL;DR.** Use **Claude Haiku 4.5** as your default. Switch
> to **GPT-5.4-mini** if you want the same quality cheaper +
> faster. Switch to **qwen3:32b on Ollama** if you have a
> local LLM server and prefer $0 / fully-self-hosted. The
> three are interchangeable; pick once and forget.

### Option 1 — Claude Haiku 4.5 *(recommended default)*

Best balance of speed (~7 s), restraint, and classification
quality. The only model that consistently classifies durable
project rules as `kind: rule` so the consolidator auto-routes
them to `_rules/<slug>.md`. ~$0.02 per consolidation; cost
is negligible for personal use.

```bash
AI_MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic
AI_MEMORY_LLM_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-…
```

Or via OpenRouter (handy if you already have an OpenRouter
account and want one bill):

```bash
AI_MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=openai-compat
AI_MEMORY_LLM_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
AI_MEMORY_LLM_MODEL=anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5
LLM_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-…
```

### Option 2 — OpenAI GPT-5.4-mini *(cheaper alternative)*

~5× cheaper than Haiku, ~2× faster (~4 s avg). Same parse
reliability, same faithfulness. One known weakness: mild
over-classification on trivial sessions (will sometimes
manufacture an extra `decisions/` page for a thin
session). Acceptable for most users.

```bash
AI_MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=openai
AI_MEMORY_LLM_MODEL=gpt-5.4-mini
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-…
```

Or via OpenRouter:

```bash
AI_MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=openai-compat
AI_MEMORY_LLM_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
AI_MEMORY_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-5.4-mini
LLM_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-…
```

### Option 3 — Local Ollama qwen3:32b *(free / self-hosted)*

$0 per consolidation. Requires a machine with at least ~24 GB
of unified or VRAM memory to keep the Q4_K_M weights warm
(~20 GB) plus headroom. Strix Halo / Apple Silicon / a
recent NVIDIA card all work. Latency is ~90 s but
consolidation is a background job — users never see it.

One-time setup on the Ollama host:

```bash
ollama pull qwen3:32b
ollama pull nomic-embed-text   # for embeddings; see below
# Recommended Ollama env:
#   OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=20m       (keep models warm between consolidations)
#   OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION=1
#   OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE=q8_0   (halves KV memory)
```

ai-memory env:

```bash
AI_MEMORY_LLM_PROVIDER=openai-compat
AI_MEMORY_LLM_BASE_URL=http://<ollama-host>:11434/v1
AI_MEMORY_LLM_MODEL=qwen3:32b
LLM_API_KEY=ollama-local                  # any non-empty value; Ollama doesn't validate
```

If you bind ai-memory to a non-loopback address so Claude
Code on a different machine can reach it, also set:

```bash
AI_MEMORY_ALLOWED_HOSTS=<your-host-or-ip>,localhost,127.0.0.1
```

(Without this rmcp's DNS-rebinding guard rejects external
`Host` headers with 403. See
[`docs/llm-provider-comparison.md`](docs/llm-provider-comparison.md)
for the discovery story.)

### What we don't recommend

- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** — strictly dominated by Haiku for
  this task: same parse reliability, 3× cost, hallucinated
  details before the prompt was tightened. Use it only if
  you specifically need extended reasoning (e.g. cross-page
  lint sweeps).
- **Reasoning-mode models** (Kimi-K2.6, Claude with extended
  thinking enabled, GPT-o3, Gemini "thinking" variants) —
  these models burn `max_tokens` budget on internal
  reasoning before emitting visible content; with the
  strict-JSON consolidation prompt they hang or emit empty
  responses. If you must use one, turn reasoning off.

### Embedding provider

The LLM provider drives consolidation + lint. Embeddings are
a *separate* concern (hybrid retrieval over the wiki — BM25
+ vector RRF). Defaults when `AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER`
is set:

| Provider | Default model | Dim |
|---|---|---|
| `openai` | `text-embedding-3-small` | 1536 |
| `voyage` | `voyage-3` | 1024 |

For the local stack, point the OpenAI embedder at Ollama:

```bash
AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai
AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL=http://<ollama-host>:11434/v1
AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_MODEL=nomic-embed-text
AI_MEMORY_EMBEDDING_DIM=768
OPENAI_API_KEY=ollama-local
```

Skipping the embedding provider entirely is fine —
`memory_query` falls back to pure FTS5 (BM25) and still
works; you just lose vector re-ranking.

Per-tier feature breakdown + the openai-compat / Ollama setup
is in [`docs/install.md`](docs/install.md#llm-provider-tiers).

## Architecture in 60 seconds

A single Rust binary, optionally containerised. Runs as an
[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server over stdio + HTTP.
Owns a data directory containing:

```
<data_dir>/
├── wiki/    # markdown source of truth (git-versioned)
├── raw/     # immutable session log archive
├── db/      # SQLite (FTS5 + page_embeddings) — derived index
├── models/  # reserved for local embedding model (v0.3+)
└── logs/    # rolling daily tracing output
```

Agent lifecycle hooks fire-and-forget POST to the server's HTTP
ingress. The server queues writes through a single SQLite writer
(no `database is locked`). On session end an optional LLM-driven pass
rewrites pages atomically with supersession (`is_latest=false` +
`supersedes` chain) and opens a typed handoff for the next agent.
The retention sweep decays unused episodic content while semantic
concept pages compound forever; pinned pages are exempt. Retrieval
is FTS5 by default; when an embedder is configured, hybrid RRF over
`page_embeddings` joins the FTS5 ranks.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the canonical
data-flow diagram + crate breakdown + cross-cutting invariants.

# Lifecycle operations

Reference for the destructive / state-touching ai-memory commands.
Read this before running anything that mutates wiki + db, especially
on a homelab box where mistakes are harder to undo.

## TL;DR — safety matrix

| Command | Safe with server **running**? | Wipes data? | Reversible? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `purge-project --confirm` | ✅ yes | the one project's data | no | Atomic `rm -rf <project_root>` on the namespaced disk path; sibling projects untouched. |
| `rename-project --from --to` | ✅ yes | no | yes (rename back) | Column-only update on `projects.name`. The on-disk dir is keyed by `project_id` (UUID), so the rename never moves a file. |
| `backup --output-path` | ✅ yes | no | n/a | Streams a gzipped tarball from the server's online `sqlite3 .backup` plus the wiki tree. Safe alongside the live writer. |
| `restore --from <tarball>` | ❌ **stop the server first** | overwrites the data dir | no (without prior backup) | Refuses if any sibling `ai-memory` process is alive (sysinfo guard). |
| `reset --confirm` | ❌ **stop the server first** | yes, all data | no | Refuses if any sibling `ai-memory` process is alive (sysinfo guard). |

All five commands route through the HTTP admin API except `reset` and
`restore`, which are direct-disk operations that fundamentally cannot
run while another process holds the SQLite WAL writer. See [CLAUDE.md
§16](../CLAUDE.md) for the invariant.

## What "project isolation" means here

Every project's data lives under an isolated, UUID-keyed root on disk:

```
<wiki_root>/
├── .git/
├── <workspace_id>/
│   └── <project_id>/
│       ├── concepts/
│       ├── decisions/
│       ├── gotchas/
│       ├── sessions/
│       ├── _rules/
│       ├── log.md
│       └── bootstrap.md
└── <other_workspace_id>/
    └── <other_project_id>/
        └── ...
```

The mutable **project name** (the human-readable `distrobox-gaming`
or `.config` you see in `/web/`) never appears in any disk path; the
stable **project_id UUID** does. SQLite's `projects.name` column maps
name → id. Two projects can have the exact same `pages.path` (e.g.
both have `decisions/0001.md`) without colliding on disk — the
namespaced layout guarantees structural isolation.

The git history is rooted at `<wiki_root>` (one repo, all projects
as subtrees). A `git log` from inside the wiki dir shows changes
across every project; per-project diffs are also possible via
`git log -- <workspace_id>/<project_id>/`.

## Command-by-command

### `purge-project`

```bash
ai-memory purge-project --workspace default --project my-project --confirm
```

What happens, in order:

1. Server looks up `(workspace_id, project_id)` by name. Returns 404
   if either is missing.
2. Counts rows that will cascade (`pages`, `sessions`,
   `observations`, `handoffs`, `page_embeddings`).
3. Single `DELETE FROM projects WHERE id = ?` — the V01 + V05
   `ON DELETE CASCADE` foreign keys propagate to every dependent
   table in one transaction.
4. `std::fs::remove_dir_all(<wiki_root>/<workspace_id>/<project_id>)`
   wipes the on-disk project root.
5. Returns a summary: `{label, pages_deleted, sessions_deleted, …,
   files_deleted: [<project_root>], files_failed: [...]}`.

Failure modes:

- **Workspace or project name not found** → 404, no mutation.
- **Confirmation flag omitted** → 400, no mutation.
- **`remove_dir_all` partial failure** (e.g. permissions) → DB
   rows are already gone but `files_failed` is populated. Re-run
   the command with the same args is idempotent; the second call
   returns 404 (project already deleted).

Why this is safe with the server running:

- The DB cascade is one transaction; the writer actor serialises
  it against any other writes.
- The on-disk delete touches only the project's UUID-keyed subdir,
  which no other project shares files with. No race with the
  watcher even mid-write — at worst the watcher emits delete
  events for files we just removed, which it ignores (no DB row
  to reindex).

### `rename-project`

```bash
ai-memory rename-project --workspace default --from old-name --to new-name
```

What happens:

1. Look up `(workspace_id, project_id)` by current name. 404 on
   miss.
2. Validate the new name: non-empty, no `/`, no leading/trailing
   whitespace. 422 on bad input.
3. `UPDATE projects SET name = ? WHERE id = ?`. UNIQUE-violation on
   the `(workspace_id, name)` index → 422 with "name taken".
4. Return `{label, from, to, pages}`.

Zero files move on disk because the disk path is keyed by
`project_id`, not name. The web UI URL `/web/w/<ws>/<proj-name>/…`
just resolves to the same `project_id` after the column update.

Failure modes:

- **`to` name already exists in this workspace** → 422.
- **`to` invalid (empty, slash, whitespace)** → 422.
- **Source `from` not found** → 404.

### `backup`

```bash
ai-memory backup --output-path /tmp/ai-memory-backup.tar.gz
```

What happens on the server:

1. SQLite online-backup API copies the live WAL DB to a temp file —
   guaranteed consistent snapshot without stopping the writer.
2. Server tar-gzips the snapshot + the wiki tree + `config.toml`.
3. Response body IS the gzipped tarball
   (`Content-Type: application/gzip`).

CLI writes the response body to `--output-path`. For a homelab user
this is the standard "snapshot before doing something dangerous"
move — `ai-memory backup` first, then proceed.

Restoring a backup follows the inverse:

```bash
# Stop the server first.
docker compose -f ~/deploy/ai-memory/docker-compose.yml down
# Restore (sysinfo refuses if the container is still running).
ai-memory restore --from /tmp/ai-memory-backup.tar.gz --data-dir /var/opt/docker/utils/ai-memory/data --confirm
# Start back up.
docker compose -f ~/deploy/ai-memory/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

The `--data-dir` flag points the CLI at the host-side path of the
docker volume (since `restore` runs directly on disk, not via the
HTTP admin API).

### `restore`

```bash
ai-memory restore --from <tarball> --data-dir <path> --confirm
```

Direct-disk operation. Refuses if any other `ai-memory` process is
alive (uses `sysinfo` to scan the process table).

Order of operations:

1. Check the data dir is empty (or the user passed `--force`).
2. Extract the tarball into the data dir.
3. Restore the SQLite snapshot in place.
4. Print a one-line summary.

Failure modes:

- **Server still running** → exits with "another ai-memory process is
  alive (pid X); stop it before restoring" — same wording as `reset`.
- **`--confirm` omitted** → exits with usage hint.
- **Data dir not empty + no `--force`** → exits with "data dir not
  empty; pass `--force` to overwrite".

### `reset`

```bash
ai-memory reset --confirm
```

Direct-disk operation. Refuses if any sibling `ai-memory` process is
alive. Removes the contents of `wiki/`, `db/`, and `raw/` under the
configured data dir. `config.toml` is preserved.

Identical sysinfo guard to `restore`. The use case is "wipe and start
over" — typically when changing major version with a breaking
migration, or when bootstrapping a new install on top of an old
data dir.

For a docker deploy where the data lives in a host-path bind mount,
you can also just `rm -rf <host-path>/*` after stopping the
container — but `ai-memory reset` is the cross-platform path that
works whether the data dir is local, bind-mounted, or in a named
volume.

## Operator workflows

### "Fresh start" (wipe everything)

For a docker / bind-mount deploy where data lives on the host:

```bash
ssh homelab
cd ~/deploy/ai-memory
docker compose down
sudo rm -rf /var/opt/docker/utils/ai-memory/data/*
docker compose up -d
```

Or via the CLI from any machine (slower but portable):

```bash
docker stop ai-memory   # so sysinfo guard passes
ai-memory reset --confirm   # against the same data dir
docker start ai-memory
```

### "Snapshot before risky op"

```bash
ai-memory backup --output-path "/tmp/ai-memory-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).tar.gz"
# … do the risky thing …
# … oh no something broke …
docker compose down
ai-memory restore --from /tmp/ai-memory-2026-05-23-1530.tar.gz --confirm
docker compose up -d
```

### "Drop one experimental project, keep everything else"

```bash
ai-memory purge-project --project experimental --confirm
# Sibling projects (ai-memory, distrobox-gaming, …) untouched.
```

### "Rename a project after `mv ~/Projects/old ~/Projects/new`"

```bash
ai-memory rename-project --from old --to new
# Future sessions in ~/Projects/new will append to the same project
# (the hook router stamps by basename(cwd) = "new"); past
# observations stay under that project too because the project_id
# is stable.
```

## Why this matters: the flat-wiki incident

Before the per-project disk layout (commits up to `e7b9a17`), the
wiki was flat: `wiki/<page-path>` regardless of project. Two
projects with the same `pages.path` shared one file on disk. The
`purge-project` handler then iterated and deleted those files,
clobbering pages owned by the sibling project. The DB rows for the
sibling survived (FK is scoped by `project_id`), but every `/web/`
click returned 404 because the on-disk file was gone.

The shipped band-aid was a `path_still_referenced` check before each
delete. The proper fix landed in `e7b9a17`: per-project disk roots
make path-collision structurally impossible. Both the band-aid and
the underlying class of bug are gone. Lifecycle ops are now safe
by construction.

This is also why `rename-project` is free: the disk path is keyed
by surrogate `project_id`, not the mutable name. Rename touches one
column; nothing moves.
